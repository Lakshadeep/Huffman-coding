Pulse  modulation  may  be  used  to  transmit  information,  such  as  continuous  speech  or 
data.  It  i s  a  system  in  which  continuous  waveforms  are  sampled  at  regular  intervals. 
Information  regarding  the  signal  is  transmitted  only  at  the  sampling  times,  together 
with  anysynchronizing pulses that may  be required. At the receiving  end, the original 
waveforms  may  be  reconstituted  from  the  informati on  regarding  the  samples,  if   these 
are  taken  frequently  enough.  Despite  the  fact  that  information  about  the  signal  is  not 
supplied  continuously,  as  in  AM  and  FM,  the  resulting  receiver  output  can  have 
negligible distortion.
